# Lazy Vim Configuration

I don't always use vim...but when I do, I'm too lazy to install plugins to make
it half-decent to work with. This is a script to make things way easier to use.
No extra features, just an easy way to get the plugins I like and the settings
I like them to have.

## Installation

One-line install:

`git clone https://github.com/pbzona/lazy-vim.git && cd lazy-vim && sudo bash install.sh`

I also include the helptags for some of the more complicated ones, so you can
access their manuals right away:

- `:help airline`
- `:help nerdtree`
- `:help fugitive`

## Credits  

Shoutout to developers of the included plugins and themes. It took me four
tries to get my bash script working properly, so I have a ton of respect for
the people that make vim worth using. Included in my preferred configuration:

- [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
- [Enhanced JS syntax](https://github.com/pangloss/vim-javascript)
- [Luna colorscheme](https://github.com/notpratheek/vim-luna)
- [Airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)
- [Airline themes](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes)
- [NERDtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
- [Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)
